The boring as fuck kind. Fan4stic. This movie is insulting as a fan of the book and the original animated Disney film. It's anger inducing to the point even thinking about it just makes me out loud say, \"fuck this movie.\" it's boring as shit to the point I'd rather watch one of the other movies I listed. Bottom line, this abomination of a movie is complete ass. Seriously, FUCK THIS MOVIE.",
