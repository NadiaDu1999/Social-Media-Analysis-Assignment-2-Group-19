The boring as fuck kind. Fan4stic. This movie is insulting as a fan of the book and the original animated Disney film. It's anger inducing to the point even thinking about it just makes me out loud say, \"fuck this movie.\" it's boring as shit to the point I'd rather watch one of the other movies I listed. Bottom line, this abomination of a movie is complete ass. Seriously, FUCK THIS MOVIE."

        "text": "Mercury poisoning doesn’t make you talk in different accents. Depp is very talented but his version of the mad hatter is literally the polar opposite of his cartoon counterpart. He doesn’t sound like he’s gone mad at all, he just sounds like someone with trauma and never had anyone around to help them grieve properly, which still wouldn’t cause you to talk in accents. Especially in Wonderland where such things as different accents just don’t exist. He’s actually looks like someone with an extra chromosome and a half. The skit they made in the video is more faithful of the original Alice in Wonderland. I had to rewatch this version to remember just how many arguments me and my siblings had over the first film by Burton. The second one was unanimously hated by all of us than goodness."

        "text": "The reason why no one can fight the Jabberwocky or the Red Queen outside Alice is that despite their powers is this: the movie is based on the two Alice books: Wonderland and Throught the Looking Glass. In fact, Jabberwocky and the Red Queen are villains in the second story and the dragon represents adulthood. Alice fighting the Jabberwocky meaning entering in the adult world, a path that ONLY her can do. That's why no one helps her: Alice must fight alone the adulthood. Also that part \"Alice is always being Alice!\" When her friends talk about finding the \"Right Alice\" they mean \"The Alice ready to fight the Jabberwocky (Adulthood). The past Alice wasn't ready to grown up and after all here adventures in Wonderland she is finally the right Alice, the one who can finally left childhood and become an adult.",

Given Britain's role in the First and Second Opium Wars during the Victorian era and the foreign domination of China through \"unequal treaties\", China expert Kevin Slaten writes, \"Not only is it troubling imagery, for a female role model in a Disney movie, but it's also a celebration of the exploitation that China suffered for a century.\"\r\n\r\nas doug said: CARE BEARS IN WONDERLAND IS A BETTER ADAPTATION THAN THIS!\r\n\r\nand this film and its 2016 sequel couldn't decide if they wanted to be direct followups, standalone films or both. these tim burton films just straight up sucks!\r\n\r\nF#@K! THIS! MOVIE!!! AND IT'S 2016 SEQUEL TOO!!!"

In fact, Wonderland has a clearly defined set of rules and logic to the world. The insanity comes from the fact these rules don't align with our own, they're like the rules in a kid's game or a dream. But there are still rules. So a guy showing up to introduce rules and laws to Wonderland would be pointless because it already has those."

Kid Doug looking up to Tim who has done a lot of great movies with a couple stinkers here and there is strikingly close to how a decent amount of YouTubers grew up admiring Nostalgia Critic but ended up flipping out over The Wall review, claiming NC never had good takes or has lost his touch. There were dozens of videos critiquing his review, thousands of hate comments from former fans, and still to this day, it is seen as a \"mark\" on NC's record. \nBut after all that, Doug continues to make great and funny Nostalgia Critic videos every week and his reviews get more creative as time goes on.  If a director can get a second chance (or third or fourth chance) after making a bad movie, so can YouTubers after a subpar or controversial video. Thanks for the awesome videos and helping me get through my university studies!"
