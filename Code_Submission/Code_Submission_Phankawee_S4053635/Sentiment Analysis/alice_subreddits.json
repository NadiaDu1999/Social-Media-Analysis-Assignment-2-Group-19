            "text": "Usually it's a flop that destroys someone's career not a hit. Can you think of any exceptions?\n\nAlice in Wonderland 2010. Burton and Depp have been in or made a lot of wide, studio released movies since that one but almost all of them have flopped. At least Depp has been in some hits since like Pirates of the Carribean 4&5, Rango, 21 Jump Street, Into the Woods, Black Mass (kinda), Fantastic Beasts 1, and Murder on the Orient Express. Burton hasn't had one hit since Alice in Wonderland. No matter what he does the movie flops or underperforms at the box office nowadays. Even when critics are like \"No, the movie's actually good\" like they did with Frankenweenie and Big Eyes, no one came. Even Dumbo couldn't turn things around. Dumbo! It seems like Alice in Wonderland pretty much killed any goodwill Burton had with people and they haven't seen a movie of his since. He could make the next Citizen Kane and, nowadays, people wouldn't come.",
