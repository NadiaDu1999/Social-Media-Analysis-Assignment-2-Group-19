            "text": "Usually it's a flop that destroys someone's career not a hit. Can you think of any exceptions?\n\nAlice in Wonderland 2010. Burton and Depp have been in or made a lot of wide, studio released movies since that one but almost all of them have flopped. At least Depp has been in some hits since like Pirates of the Carribean 4&5, Rango, 21 Jump Street, Into the Woods, Black Mass (kinda), Fantastic Beasts 1, and Murder on the Orient Express. Burton hasn't had one hit since Alice in Wonderland. No matter what he does the movie flops or underperforms at the box office nowadays. Even when critics are like \"No, the movie's actually good\" like they did with Frankenweenie and Big Eyes, no one came. Even Dumbo couldn't turn things around. Dumbo! It seems like Alice in Wonderland pretty much killed any goodwill Burton had with people and they haven't seen a movie of his since. He could make the next Citizen Kane and, nowadays, people wouldn't come.",

He made *Schindler's List,* and that experience made him very sensitive around the whole Hitler and holocaust thing. So when she made a comment comparing Bay to Hitler, Spielberg was having none of that and removed her from the franchise.",

I read that it was the experience making *Schindler's List* that made him sensitive. One example of this, after *Schindler's List,* Spielberg had a reflection on his making the Indiana Jones and questioned if he was appropriate with how he portrayed the Nazis as an archetypical villain. He felt like he didn't truly captured the evil of Nazis and worried that the audience would take the light take on Indy Jones's Nazis as an indictator of what they really were. I think I read this in The Men Who Would be Kings.",

It\u2019s not like a company job with pay bands and a hierarchy and role progression. You could just career progression in a whole bunch of ways. Critical response, awards, net worth etc etc\n\nZoe Saldana\u2019s been in three out of the top five highest grossing movies of all time, but Robert Downey Jr is the one getting 75 million for Endgame",
