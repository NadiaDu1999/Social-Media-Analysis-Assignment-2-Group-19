According to director Kelsey Mann, the new character promises to stir things up within headquarters. \\u201cAnxiety, voiced by Maya Hawke, might be new to the crew, but she\\u2019s not really the type to take a back seat,\\u201d said Mann. \\u201cThat makes a lot of sense if you think about it in terms of what goes on inside all our minds.\\u201d A trailer, poster and film stills are now available for what promises to be the feel-good (or feel-everything) film of Summer 2024.\\n \\nDisney and Pixar\\u2019s \\u201cInside Out 2\\u201d returns to the mind of newly minted teenager Riley just as headquarters is undergoing a sudden demolition to make room for something entirely unexpected: new Emotions! Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust, who\\u2019ve long been running a successful operation by all accounts, aren\\u2019t sure how to feel when Anxiety shows up. And it looks like she\\u2019s not alone. Maya Hawke lends her voice to Anxiety, alongside Amy Poehler as Joy, Phyllis Smith as Sadness, Lewis Black as Anger, Tony Hale as Fear, and Liza Lapira as Disgust. Directed by Kelsey Mann and produced by Mark Nielsen, \\u201cInside Out 2\\u201d releases only in theaters Summer 2024.\",\n",

According to director Kelsey Mann, the new character promises to stir things up within headquarters. \\u201cAnxiety, voiced by Maya Hawke, might be new to the crew, but she\\u2019s not really the type to take a back seat,\\u201d said Mann. \\u201cThat makes a lot of sense if you think about it in terms of what goes on inside all our minds.\\u201d A trailer, poster and film stills are now available for what promises to be the feel-good (or feel-everything) film of Summer 2024.\\n \\nDisney and Pixar\\u2019s \\u201cInside Out 2\\u201d returns to the mind of newly minted teenager Riley just as headquarters is undergoing a sudden demolition to make room for something entirely unexpected: new Emotions! Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust, who\\u2019ve long been running a successful operation by all accounts, aren\\u2019t sure how to feel when Anxiety shows up. And it looks like she\\u2019s not alone. Maya Hawke lends her voice to Anxiety, alongside Amy Poehler as Joy, Phyllis Smith as Sadness, Lewis Black as Anger, Tony Hale as Fear, and Liza Lapira as Disgust. Directed by Kelsey Mann and produced by Mark Nielsen, \\u201cInside Out 2\\u201d releases only in theaters Summer 2024.\"\n",
