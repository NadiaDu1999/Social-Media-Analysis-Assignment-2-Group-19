But then, 3,000 years ago, their voyages stopped for a millennium \u2013 and no one knows exactly why. From Walt Disney Animation Studios comes \u201cMoana,\u201d a sweeping, CG-animated feature film about an adventurous teenager who is inspired to leave the safety and security of her island on a daring journey to save her people. Inexplicably drawn to the ocean, Moana (voice of Auli\u02bbi Cravalho) convinces the mighty demigod Maui (voice of Dwayne Johnson) to join her mission, and he reluctantly helps her become a wayfinder like her ancestors who sailed before her. Together, they voyage across the open ocean on an action-packed adventure, encountering enormous monsters and impossible odds, and along the way, Moana fulfills her quest and discovers the one thing she\u2019s always sought: her own identity. Directed by the renowned filmmaking team of Ron Clements and John Musker (\u201cThe Little Mermaid,\u201d \u201cAladdin,\u201d \u201cThe Princess & the Frog\u201d), produced by Osnat Shurer (\u201cLifted,\u201d \u201cOne Man Band\u201d), and featuring music by Lin-Manuel Miranda, Mark Mancina and Opetaia Foa\u2018i, \u201cMoana\u201d is sailing on Disney+ now.\n\n#DisneyMoana #HowFarIllGo #AuliiCravalho\n\n\"How Far I'll Go\" from Disney's Moana\nPerformed by: Auli\u02bbi Cravalho\n\nMusic video by Auli'i Cravalho performing How Far I'll Go.

Encountering Everest-like conditions, mystical trolls and a hilarious snowman named Olaf (voice of Josh Gad), Anna and Kristoff battle the elements in a race to save the kingdom. \n\nThe film is directed by Chris Buck (\"Tarzan,\" \"Surf's Up\") and Jennifer Lee (screenwriter, \"Wreck-It Ralph\"), who also wrote the screenplay.

According to director Kelsey Mann, the new character promises to stir things up within headquarters. \u201cAnxiety, voiced by Maya Hawke, might be new to the crew, but she\u2019s not really the type to take a back seat,\u201d said Mann. \u201cThat makes a lot of sense if you think about it in terms of what goes on inside all our minds.\u201d A trailer, poster and film stills are now available for what promises to be the feel-good (or feel-everything) film of Summer 2024.\n \nDisney and Pixar\u2019s \u201cInside Out 2\u201d returns to the mind of newly minted teenager Riley just as headquarters is undergoing a sudden demolition to make room for something entirely unexpected: new Emotions! Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust, who\u2019ve long been running a successful operation by all accounts, aren\u2019t sure how to feel when Anxiety shows up. And it looks like she\u2019s not alone. Maya Hawke lends her voice to Anxiety, alongside Amy Poehler as Joy, Phyllis Smith as Sadness, Lewis Black as Anger, Tony Hale as Fear, and Liza Lapira as Disgust. Directed by Kelsey Mann and produced by Mark Nielsen, \u201cInside Out 2\u201d releases only in theaters Summer 2024.",

        "description": "Cinderella (2015)\nIn-Home Release Date: September 15, 2015 \nOn Blu-ray: http://di.sn/6004BHU1A, Digital HD & Disney Movies Anywhere: http://di.sn/6005BHUHP\n\nA new Frozen short, Frozen Fever, featuring all of your favorite characters and a brand new song, will play in theatres with Cinderella beginning March 13!\n\nThe story of \"Cinderella\" follows the fortunes of young Ella (Lily James) whose merchant father remarries following the death of her mother. Eager to support her loving father, Ella welcomes her new stepmother (Cate Blanchett) and her daughters Anastasia (Holliday Grainger) and Drisella (Sophie McShera) into the family home. But, when Ella's father unexpectedly passes away, she finds herself at the mercy of a jealous and cruel new family. Finally relegated to nothing more than a servant girl covered in ashes, and spitefully renamed Cinderella, Ella could easily begin to lose hope. Yet, despite the cruelty inflicted upon her, Ella is determined to honor her mother's dying words and to \"have courage and be kind.\" She will not give in to despair nor despise those who mistreat her. And then there is the dashing stranger she meets in the woods. Unaware that he is really a prince, not merely an apprentice at the Palace, Ella finally feels she has met a kindred soul. It appears her fortunes may be about to change when the Palace sends out an open invitation for all maidens to attend a ball, raising Ella's hopes of once again encountering the charming Kit (Richard Madden). Alas, her stepmother forbids her to attend and callously rips apart her dress. But, as in all good fairy tales, help is at hand, and a kindly beggar woman (Helena Bonham-Carter) steps forward and -- armed with a pumpkin and a few mice -- changes Cinderella's life forever.\n\n\nWebsite: http://www.disney.com/Cinderella\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/Cinderella\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/disneystudios\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/DisneyPictures",

          "title": "Disney's Cinderella Official US Trailer",
          "description": "Cinderella (2015)\nIn-Home Release Date: September 15, 2015 \nOn Blu-ray: http://di.sn/6004BHU1A, Digital HD & Disney Movies Anywhere: http://di.sn/6005BHUHP\n\nA new Frozen short, Frozen Fever, featuring all of your favorite characters and a brand new song, will play in theatres with Cinderella beginning March 13!\n\nThe story of \"Cinderella\" follows the fortunes of young Ella (Lily James) whose merchant father remarries following the death of her mother. Eager to support her loving father, Ella welcomes her new stepmother (Cate Blanchett) and her daughters Anastasia (Holliday Grainger) and Drisella (Sophie McShera) into the family home. But, when Ella's father unexpectedly passes away, she finds herself at the mercy of a jealous and cruel new family. Finally relegated to nothing more than a servant girl covered in ashes, and spitefully renamed Cinderella, Ella could easily begin to lose hope. Yet, despite the cruelty inflicted upon her, Ella is determined to honor her mother's dying words and to \"have courage and be kind.\" She will not give in to despair nor despise those who mistreat her. And then there is the dashing stranger she meets in the woods. Unaware that he is really a prince, not merely an apprentice at the Palace, Ella finally feels she has met a kindred soul. It appears her fortunes may be about to change when the Palace sends out an open invitation for all maidens to attend a ball, raising Ella's hopes of once again encountering the charming Kit (Richard Madden). Alas, her stepmother forbids her to attend and callously rips apart her dress. But, as in all good fairy tales, help is at hand, and a kindly beggar woman (Helena Bonham-Carter) steps forward and -- armed with a pumpkin and a few mice -- changes Cinderella's life forever.\n\n\nWebsite: http://www.disney.com/Cinderella\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/Cinderella\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/disneystudios\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/DisneyPictures"
