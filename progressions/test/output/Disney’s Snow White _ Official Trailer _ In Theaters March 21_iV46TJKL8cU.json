However, discussions often focus only on white and black representation, while Asian and other cultures are overlooked in movies and animation.  \nDiversity should aim for fairness for everyone, but in reality, only certain groups are prioritized, while others are barely explored and are treated superficially in entertainment media.  \nIn the end, the term \"diversity\" is often used as an excuse for self-satisfaction and personal agendas, rather than achieving true equality.  \n\nDestroying the image that fans cherish and forcing diversity in a way that hurts them is a form of violence.  \nDiversity should bring happiness to everyone, but when it is imposed, it only creates more unhappiness.  \nPeople need to take a step back and think‚Äîwhat is diversity really for?  \n\nIn the same series, a new princess with different skin or hair color can be introduced in a separate title. Isn't that already a wonderful way to embrace diversity?  \n\nValues should never be forced upon others.  \nIt‚Äôs not just about appearance‚Äîsome people love the idea of waiting for a prince like the classic princesses, some want to go on a journey to find their prince, and some don‚Äôt need a prince at all.  \nAccepting all of these perspectives is what true diversity should be.  \n\nSaying \"this is how it should be\" is just another form of violence.  \nThere will always be people who suffer when something is forced upon them.  \n\nI feel that creating new works that respect the original story, the source material, and diverse races and cultures is a wonderful way to embrace true representation.
